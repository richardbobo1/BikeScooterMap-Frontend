![DC BikeScooter Map](/src/assets/preview-screenshot.png)

*DC BikeScooter Map is an application built using Ruby on Rails for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.*

DC BikeScooter Map was built to provide a centralized map for locating shared bike and scooters in DC. 

# Summary 

DC BikeScooter Map is an app where uses can locate bike or scooters nearby. Once they find a bike or scooter that they want to reserve, the user can click the logo marker and follow the link to the appropriate app in order to complete their reservation. The users can toggle the menu of companies should they have preference of seeing the companies they prefer. Users who want to check docks vs. bike availability for Capital Bikeshare stations can click the station market and see review availability. 

The number one benefit of using this app is the ability to aggregate all bike share data onto one app rather than switching between apps to find the closest available bike or scooter. 

* A user has the ability to:
     * Create, update, and delete a user account
     * Toggle which bike and scooters that would like to see on the map
     * View company and station details by clicking on a map marker
     * Refresh the map for latest available bikes/scooters and their location
